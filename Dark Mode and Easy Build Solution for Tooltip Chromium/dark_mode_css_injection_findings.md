## Dark Mode CSS Injection Findings

**Problem:** The current implementation attempts to inject CSS for dark mode using `ExecuteJavaScript` which is failing due to an undeclared `web_contents` variable.

**Potential Solutions for CSS Injection:**

1.  **`WebContents::InsertCSS()`:** This appears to be the most direct and idiomatic way to inject CSS into a `WebContents` in Chromium. Several search results (especially from Electron documentation and a `WebContents.java` file in Chromium source) point to an `insertCSS` method. If a C++ equivalent exists in the `content::WebContents` API, this would be the preferred approach.

2.  **Using `ExecuteJavaScript` (Correctly):** If `InsertCSS` is not directly available or suitable for the specific Chromium version/context, the existing `ExecuteJavaScript` approach can be made to work, provided the `web_contents` variable scope issue is resolved. The JavaScript would typically create a `<style>` element, set its `textContent` to the desired CSS, and append it to the document's `<head>`.

**Next Steps for Dark Mode CSS Injection:**
*   Investigate the `content::WebContents` C++ API for an `InsertCSS` method. This would be the cleanest solution.
*   If `InsertCSS` is not found or applicable, focus on resolving the `web_contents` undeclared error to make the `ExecuteJavaScript` approach functional.
