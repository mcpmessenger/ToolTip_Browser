# Product Requirements Document: Chromium Fork with Tooltip Companion Functionality

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of a custom Chromium-based browser that integrates the innovative functionality of tooltipcompanion.com. The goal is to enhance the user's browsing experience by providing proactive, context-aware tooltips that display screenshot previews of interactive web elements (buttons and links) before they are clicked. This document details the product's purpose, features, technical requirements, and integration considerations, serving as a foundational guide for the development team.

Traditional web browsing often involves uncertainty regarding the outcome of clicking a button or a link. Users may hesitate, leading to a less efficient and sometimes frustrating experience.
