# Research Topics for Chromium Build Issues

## üîç Primary Research Areas

### 1. **Windows Resource Compiler (rc.exe) Issues**

#### **Specific Problems to Research:**
- Why can't the build system find `rc.exe` despite it being installed?
- How does Chromium's build system resolve tool paths in subprocess calls?
- Are there known compatibility issues with Visual Studio 2022 and Chromium builds?

#### **Research Questions:**
- What are the common solutions for rc.exe not found errors in Chromium builds?
- Are there specific Visual Studio 2022 configurations needed for Chromium?
- How do other developers handle this issue on Windows?

#### **Resources to Check:**
- Chromium build documentation for Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 compatibility with Chromium
- Stack Overflow discussions about rc.exe issues
- Chromium developer forums and issue trackers

### 2. **Alternative Build Methods**

#### **Docker-Based Builds:**
- Can we build Chromium in a Docker container on Windows?
- What are the performance implications?
- How would this affect our development workflow?

#### **Pre-built Chromium Modification:**
- Can we download a pre-built Chromium and modify it?
- What are the limitations of this approach?
- How would we integrate our tooltip companion code?

#### **Cross-Compilation:**
- Can we build on Linux and target Windows?
- What are the toolchain requirements?
- How would this affect our development process?

### 3. **Build System Workarounds**

#### **GN Build Arguments:**
- Are there arguments to skip resource compilation?
- Can we disable problematic components?
- What are the implications of skipping resources?

#### **Toolchain Modifications:**
- Can we modify the build system to find rc.exe?
- Are there alternative resource compilation methods?
- How can we patch the build system?

### 4. **Alternative Implementation Approaches**

#### **Browser Extension:**
- Could we implement this as a Chrome extension instead?
- What are the limitations compared to a fork?
- How would performance be affected?

#### **Electron-Based Solution:**
- Could we build this as an Electron app?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages?
- How would this compare to a Chromium fork?

#### **WebAssembly Approach:**
- Could we implement the core functionality in WebAssembly?
- What are the performance implications?
- How would this integrate with the browser?
